# Web Apps Project 5 // Room Booking Apps

## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual page would look like
  * how the page are connected to each other
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the page piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

In the _Room Booking Apps_ project, you'll create an app that allows you to view all conference/meeting room or by search filter and select rooms you want to book at certain date and time. The project emphasizes using every element you learn in this Degree.

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the Vue, Node code, and Database that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own files you need.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your web application on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser installed on their machine.

#### Considerations

The focus of this project is on writing functional Vue and Node code, not on making the page beautiful. Feel free to spend some time working on your layout and CSS if you want to, but the goal for this project is correct functionality.

### Project Instructions & Rubric

#### How will this project be evaluated

Your project will be evaluated by a KODEgree Code Reviewer according to the rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

The project rubric is your source of truth while building this project. Save it to your browser bookmarks so you can access it easily!

#### Submission Instructions

If you choose to develop on your local machine you will need to:

Upload your zip file to Hacktiv8 Online Program Projects submissions.
