# Web Apps Project 3 // Fitness Companion Apps

## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual page would look like
  * how the page are connected to each other
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the page piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

In the _Fitness Companion_ _Apps_ project, you'll create an app that allows you manage/set your daily workout and give you suggestion from list of all workout template available. The project emphasizes using Vue to maintain the front-end and Express to maintain the backend of the apps.

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the Vue and Node code that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own files you need.

#### App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays 2 button/link to navigate between Personal Workout and Precompiled Workout. Personal Workout is an own workout set by user whatever they want. Precompiled Workout are list of precompiled workout named by superhero \(eg. Batman Workout contains: 20 squats, 40 punches, etc\)

When user navigate to Personal Workout, user should see input and add button to add their personal workout. User receiving a list of personal workout added along with a checkbox in each workout to mark whether its done or not.

When user navigate to Hero Workout, user should see list of precompiled workout from json containing images and title of workout. User could click detail button to view the detail of workout such as title and list of moves.

The hero page also has a search form that allows you to find hero workout to see the details.

The search form has a text input that may be used to filter hero workout quickly. As the value of the text input changes, the hero workout that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you view the detail of workout.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your web application on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser installed on their machine.

#### Considerations

The focus of this project is on writing functional Vue and Node code, not on making the page beautiful. Feel free to spend some time working on your layout and CSS if you want to, but the goal for this project is correct functionality.
