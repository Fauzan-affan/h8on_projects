# RCT 3 // Event Management Apps

## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual page would look like
  * how the page are connected to each other
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the page piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

In the _Event Management Apps_ project, you'll create an app that allows you to add new event contain date time and countdown to the event. You can display the list of every event you made with countdown to event. The project emphasizes using React Native to build the app.

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the React and Redux code that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own using the Create React App.

#### App Functionality

In this application, you will have 2 views: main page, and new event page. The main page displays some component such as Title and List of Event.

And the add new event page display form contain date time and the name of event.

The homepage allows you to search event quickly and display all of event in list with countdown. The static home page \(and your completed app\) should look something like this.

The new event button allows you to add new event with form contain date time and name of event. And when you click save, event will show in the list of event in homepage, showing countdown of event until it disappear.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your web application on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser installed on their machine.

#### Considerations

The focus of this project is on writing functional React Native code, not on making the page beautiful. Feel free to spend some time working on your layout and CSS if you want to, but the goal for this project is correct functionality.

### Project Instructions & Rubric

#### Before Submitting

Make sure your code adheres to our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git style guidelines.

* KODEgree's HTML Style Guide
* KODEgree's CSS Style Guide
* KODEgree's JavaScript Style Guide
* KODEgree's Git Style Guide

We recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our guidelines.

#### How will this project be evaluated

Your project will be evaluated by a KODEgree Code Reviewer according to the rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

The project rubric is your source of truth while building this project. Save it to your browser bookmarks so you can access it easily!

#### Submission Instructions

If you choose to develop on your local machine you will need to:

Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch. On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub" Select the repository for this project \(you may need to connect your GitHub account first\).

### Step by Step Guide For Building Travel Guide Website

#### Planning Stage üìê

**Step 1 - Draw All of the Page of the App** We need to determine the look and functionality of each view in your app. One of the best approaches is to draw each view of the app on paper so that you'll have a good idea of what information and data you're planning to have on each page.

Instead of paper and pencil, you can be a bit more digital and use software for creating mockups. If you were given project specifications, check your mock against them to make sure that you have all of the required features. For the exercises that follow, your can just draw what you're trying to create on paper.

**Step 2 - Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components** For this step,

* draw boxes around every component; and
* arrange our components into a hierarchy

**Step 3 - Determine the Data Each Component Needs** For each component, determine which data is the component accessing, getting, modifying, or showing.

#### Coding Stageüî®

**Step 1 - Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy.**

**Step 2 - Build A Static Version in React; including every component needed.**

**Step 3 - Build Add new event form.**

**Step 4 - Store all State in Redux.**

**Step 5 - Add Inverse Data Flow.**

**Step 6 - Make sure that everything works as expected.**

**Step 7 - Add navigation to / \(root page\).**

**Step 8 - Add finishing touches and make sure the project meets the rubric.**

Remember, this is just a template. As you build more projects, you'll modify this template to suit your needs. You may also find it more intuitive to use a different approach. Regardless of the approach you take, however, planning out your app is imperative to success.

### Projects Submission

#### Instructions

Please verify that your project adheres to our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git style guidelines.

If you chose to develop on your local machine \(by either starting with the starter project or starting from scratch with Create React App\), you will need to:

* Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch.
* On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub"
* Select the repository for this project \(you may need to connect your GitHub account first\).

#### Project Submission Checklist

Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.

* I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \(If not, I will discuss with my mentor prior to submitting.\)
* Project builds correctly without errors and runs.
* All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.

Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!
