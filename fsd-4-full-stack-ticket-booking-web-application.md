# FSD 4 // Full-Stack Ticket Booking Web Application

## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual page would look like
  * how the page are connected to each other
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the page piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

In the _Full-Stack Ticket Booking Web Application_ project, you'll create an app that allows you to view all destinations/place or by its city and select destination you want to see the detail price of accommodation. The project emphasizes using every element you learn in this Degree.

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the Vue, Node code, and Database that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own files you need.

#### App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays 2 button/link to navigate between Personal Workout and Hero Workout. Personal Workout is an own workout set by user whatever they want. Hero Workout are list of precompiled workout named by superhero \(eg. Batman Workout contains: 20 squats, 40 punches, etc\)

When user navigate to Personal Workout, user should see input and add button to add their personal workout. User receiving a list of personal workout added along with a checkbox in each workout to mark whether its done or not.

When user navigate to Hero Workout, user should see list of precompiled workout from json containing images and title of workout. User could click detail button to view the detail of workout such as title and list of moves.

The hero page also has a search form that allows you to find hero workout to see the details.

The search form has a text input that may be used to filter hero workout quickly. As the value of the text input changes, the hero workout that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you view the detail of workout.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your web application on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser installed on their machine.

#### Considerations

The focus of this project is on writing functional Vue and Node code, not on making the page beautiful. Feel free to spend some time working on your layout and CSS if you want to, but the goal for this project is correct functionality.

### Project Instructions & Rubric

#### Before Submitting

Make sure your code adheres to our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git style guidelines.

* KODEgree's HTML Style Guide
* KODEgree's CSS Style Guide

* KODEgree's Git Style Guide

We recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our guidelines.

#### How will this project be evaluated

Your project will be evaluated by a KODEgree Code Reviewer according to the rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

The project rubric is your source of truth while building this project. Save it to your browser bookmarks so you can access it easily!

#### Submission Instructions

If you choose to develop on your local machine you will need to:

Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch. On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub" Select the repository for this project \(you may need to connect your GitHub account first\).

### Step by Step Guide For Building Travel Guide Website

#### Planning Stage üìê

**Step 1 - Draw All of the Page of the App** We need to determine the look and functionality of each view in your app. One of the best approaches is to draw each view of the app on paper so that you'll have a good idea of what information and data you're planning to have on each page.

Instead of paper and pencil, you can be a bit more digital and use software for creating mockups. If you were given project specifications, check your mock against them to make sure that you have all of the required features. For the exercises that follow, your can just draw what you're trying to create on paper.

**Step 2 - Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components** For this step,

* draw boxes around every component; and
* arrange our components into a hierarchy

**Step 3 - Determine the Data Each Component Needs** For each component, determine which data is the component accessing, getting, modifying, or showing.

#### Coding Stageüî®

**Step 1 - Create Express project to make server up and running on port 3000.**

**Step 2 - Build a static version of Homepage, Personal Workout and Hero Workout.**

**Step 3 - Create a Card/List to hold data of Hero Workout and Personal Workout.**

**Step 4 - Create add and delete Personal Workout in backend.**

**Step 5 - Get data from Workout JSON and display data to the Hero Workout.**

**Step 6 - Make sure that everything works as expected.**

**Step 7 - Add navigation \(if necessary\).**

**Step 8 - Add finishing touches and make sure the project meets the rubric.**

Remember, this is just a template. As you build more projects, you'll modify this template to suit your needs. You may also find it more intuitive to use a different approach. Regardless of the approach you take, however, planning out your app is imperative to success.

### Projects Submission
