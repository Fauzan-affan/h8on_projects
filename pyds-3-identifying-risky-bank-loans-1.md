## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the syntax piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

Applying what you‚Äôve learned, present a simple Python Markdown document in which you demonstrate the use of logistic regression on the **lbb\_loans.csv** dataset. Explain your findings wherever necessary and show the necessary data preparation steps. To help you through the exercise, consider the following questions throughout the document:

* How do we correctly interpret the negative coefficients obtained from your logistic regression?
* How do we know which of the variables are more statistically significant as predictors?
* What are some strategies to improve your model?

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own jupyter notebook file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the Python markup that may be used but omits the Algorithm  that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the Python from scratch. The provided code will guide you to finish the application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own jupyter notebook file but we recommend if you download the starter code.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your jupyter notebook on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser and anaconda installed on their machine.

### Project Instructions & Rubric

#### Before Submitting

Make sure your code adheres to our Python and Git style guidelines.

* KODEgree's Python Style Guide
* KODEgree's Git Style Guide

We recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our guidelines.

#### How will this project be evaluated

Your project will be evaluated by a KODEgree Code Reviewer according to the rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

The project rubric is your source of truth while building this project. Save it to your browser bookmarks so you can access it easily!

#### Submission Instructions

If you choose to develop on your local machine you will need to:

Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch. On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub" Select the repository for this project \(you may need to connect your GitHub account first\).

### Projects Submission

#### Instructions
