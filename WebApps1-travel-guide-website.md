## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual page would look like
  * how the page are connected to each other
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the page piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

In the _Travel Guide Website_ project, you'll create a landing page that allows you to view all destinations/place or by its city and select destination you want to see the detail price/expenses of accommodation. The project emphasizes using HTML to build the webpage, CSS to style the webpage, Javascript and DOM to view destination by city and to calculate the price of accommodation.

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the JS code that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own index.html file and all of the CSS and Javascript files you need.

#### App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of all destinations \(i.e. Kota Tua, Bandungan, etc\), each of which contains a city to group. The destination must contains:

* Destination Title
* Description
* Destination Image
* Location
* Expenses

The homepage of the Travel Guide shows the title and then all the list of destinations also the city drop down button to filter. You can also add the search input to search destinations quickly. The static home page \(and your completed app\) should look something like this.

Each destination has a control that lets you select the destination to calculate for expenses. When you select a different destinations, the expenses will sum with previous destination and calculate the final estimated price. Note that the default value for the total price should always be zero if there is no destination selected.

The detail page should launch a modal box to show the detail such as Destination Title, Description, Destination Image, Location, Expenses, and the "Add to Wishlist" button to calculate the expenses and close button to navigate to home page.

![Travel Guide Modal](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-10-24-at-15.48.19.png)

The main page also has a search form that allows you to find destinations to add to your Wishlist.

The search form has a text input that may be used to find destination quickly. As the value of the text input changes, the destinations that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the destination to your Go.

When you navigate back to the main page from the destination detail modal, you should instantly see all of the destination you listed before.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your web application on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser installed on their machine.

#### Considerations

The focus of this project is on writing functional HTML, CSS, and JS code, not on making the page beautiful. Feel free to spend some time working on your layout and CSS if you want to, but the goal for this project is correct functionality.
