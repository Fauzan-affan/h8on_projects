# RCT 1 // Podcast Client

## Projects Concepts

### Approaching a Project

Developing a large project is hard. Don't just dive in and try to tackle the entire thing all at once. As the famous saying goes:

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

Start with a plan! Here are some steps that I like to follow when building a project:

* outline the steps needed to build the project
* draw the application
  * what individual page would look like
  * how the page are connected to each other
* write down the pseudocode
* develop the page piece by piece

And just before submitting:

* squash all bugs
* check the rubric and make sure that your project meets all requirements

Take it slow and practice your newly acquired skills. You've got this! üôåüèº

If you get stuck, take advantage of your mentorship services.

### Project Overview

In the _MyPod - Podcast Client_ project, you'll create a podcast app that allows you to get data from podcast API and show the data at you apps. You can select single podcast and listen to podcast directly from the app. The project emphasizes using React to build the apps, navigate between app using react-router.

#### Get the Project

You have a few options to start developing this project:

* forking and cloning the start repository
* starting from scratch with make your own file

#### Starter Code

If you'd like to work locally on your own computer, fork and clone the starter repository.

The code in the starter repo contains all the CSS and HTML markup that may be used but omits the React code that is required to complete the project. This can save you some time if you don't wish to write all the CSS and HTML from scratch. The provided code will demonstrate a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality.

#### Starting from Scratch

If you'd like to start completely from scratch, you can make your own using the Create React App.

#### App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of all podcast. The main page must contains:

* Title
* Search
* List view of Podcast

And the podcast list view must contains:

* Podcast Title
* Podcast Image
* Podcast Detail Button

The homepage of the Podcast Client shows the title "MyPod" and then all the list of podcast. You can also add the search input to search podcast quickly. The static home page \(and your completed app\) should look something like this.

Each podcast has a control that lets you select the podcast to listen. When you select a podcast, you should be redirected to detail page.

The detail page should contains Podcast image, Podcast Title, Podcast Description, and Podcast Player Control such as play and pause button.

The main page also has a search form that allows you to find podcast to listen.

The search form has a text input that may be used to filter the podcast quickly. As the value of the text input changes, the podcast that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you view the detail of your podcast.

When you navigate back to the main page from the podcast detail page, you should instantly see all of the podcast you listed before.

#### Submission Requirements

Your submission should include all of the files necessary to launch your web application on a browser. You can assume that your reviewer will have browser installed on their machine.

#### Considerations

The focus of this project is on writing functional React code, not on making the page beautiful. Feel free to spend some time working on your layout and CSS if you want to, but the goal for this project is correct functionality.

### Project Instructions & Rubric

#### Before Submitting

Make sure your code adheres to our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git style guidelines.

* KODEgree's HTML Style Guide
* KODEgree's CSS Style Guide
* KODEgree's JavaScript Style Guide
* KODEgree's Git Style Guide

We recommend using Git from the very beginning. Make sure to commit often and to use well-formatted commit messages that conform to our guidelines.

#### How will this project be evaluated

Your project will be evaluated by a KODEgree Code Reviewer according to the rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

The project rubric is your source of truth while building this project. Save it to your browser bookmarks so you can access it easily!

#### Submission Instructions

If you choose to develop on your local machine you will need to:

Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch. On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub" Select the repository for this project \(you may need to connect your GitHub account first\).

### Step by Step Guide For Building Travel Guide Website

#### Planning Stage üìê

**Step 1 - Draw All of the Page of the App** We need to determine the look and functionality of each view in your app. One of the best approaches is to draw each view of the app on paper so that you'll have a good idea of what information and data you're planning to have on each page.

Instead of paper and pencil, you can be a bit more digital and use software for creating mockups. If you were given project specifications, check your mock against them to make sure that you have all of the required features. For the exercises that follow, your can just draw what you're trying to create on paper.

**Step 2 - Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components** For this step,

* draw boxes around every component; and
* arrange our components into a hierarchy

**Step 3 - Determine the Data Each Component Needs** For each component, determine which data is the component accessing, getting, modifying, or showing.

#### Coding Stageüî®

**Step 1 - Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy.**

**Step 2 - Build A Static Version in React; including the search form, and the list view of podcast.**

**Step 3 - Identify The Minimal \(but complete\) Representation Of UI State.**

**Step 4 - Identify Where Your State Should Live.**

**Step 5 - Add Inverse Data Flow.**

**Step 6 - Make sure that everything works as expected.**

**Step 7 - Add navigation to / \(root page\).**

**Step 8 - Add finishing touches and make sure the project meets the rubric.**

Remember, this is just a template. As you build more projects, you'll modify this template to suit your needs. You may also find it more intuitive to use a different approach. Regardless of the approach you take, however, planning out your app is imperative to success.

### Projects Submission

#### Instructions

Please verify that your project adheres to our HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git style guidelines.

If you chose to develop on your local machine \(by either starting with the starter project or starting from scratch with Create React App\), you will need to:

* Push your project to GitHub, making sure to push the master branch.
* On the project submission page choose the option "Submit with GitHub"
* Select the repository for this project \(you may need to connect your GitHub account first\).

#### Project Submission Checklist

Before submitting your project, please review and confirm the following items.

* I am confident all rubric items have been met and my project will pass as submitted. \(If not, I will discuss with my mentor prior to submitting.\)
* Project builds correctly without errors and runs.
* All required functionality exists and my project behaves as expected per the project's specifications.

Once you have checked all these items, you are ready to submit!
